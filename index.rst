Abstract

The First Look Analysis and Feedback Functionality working group has produced a set of requirements (SITCOMTN-025 and SITCOMTN-037) that include a Rapid Analysis capability (SITCOMTN-037 ยง3.1).  This document proposes a framework for executing this analysis and methods for enhancing consistency of algorithmic processing between Rapid Analysis, Alert Production, and other Science Pipelines uses.
